[plugins]

# search path under lib/Agent/Sentinel/Plugin/
# to look for and load plugins where 
# * Core 
#   is a directory containg plugin(s) that ship
#   with this module
# * YourOwnPlugins
#   is a directory structure containing plugins
#   that you have added and will not be altered
#   by uprades to this module
#   
# there can be zero or more extra plugin directories
# like this but there must be at least 'Core'
# 

# tasks are defined by section names that start with 
# the string 'task ' followed by a number or word 
# for example :
#
# [task 10]
#
# ( a space ' ' must be included after the word 
# 'task' ) 
#
# tasks are sorted alpha numerically 
# so the order in which each task first runs is 
# dictated by this sort order
